# AOP-JRP

AOP-JRP is an enhanced Area of Play (AOP) and Priority Management script for FiveM, specifically designed for JRP (Justice Roleplay) servers. This script allows administrators to manage in-game priorities and AOP dynamically, with improved visuals and optimizations.

## Features

- **Dynamic AOP Management**: Set and update the Area of Play in real-time.
- **Priority System**: Manage priorities for different regions (City, Blaine, Global) with statuses like Cooldown, Hold, In Progress, Pending, and Reset.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Semi-transparent backgrounds, color-coded text (green for priorities, blue for AOP), and unified rendering for a cooler look.
- **Discord Logging**: Automatic logging of changes to a Discord webhook for monitoring.
- **Optimized Performance**: Localized functions, efficient string handling, and modern Lua 5.4 practices.
- **Debug Mode**: Optional debug mode to remove permission requirements for testing.

## Improvements

### Before
- Basic AOP and priority management.
- Simple text rendering without backgrounds.
- Redundant code in rendering functions.
- Older header information and branding.

### After
- Rebranded to AOP-JRP with updated headers.
- Added semi-transparent black backgrounds for better contrast.
- Unified rendering functions to reduce redundancy.
- Changed priority text to green and AOP to blue for visual appeal.
- Optimized code with local functions and string.format for efficiency.
- Updated to latest FiveM standards (fx_version 'cerulean', lua54 'yes').
- Improved config structure with better comments and formatting.
- Enhanced Discord logging with formatted messages.
